Prevent accidental overwriting of autosaves, **cycle through more autosave files**, and autosave more/less often.

This mod gives you more options about periodic saving. By default RimWorld uses 5 file names (Autosave-1 to Autosave-5), but using "More Autosave Slots" you can increase, and decrease this number to fit your needs. Even down to only one file.

Do you regularly play more than one game? Are multiple people using the same account? **Don't lose your progress!** This mod uses a more descriptive naming scheme than "Autosave-X", and you can edit the naming scheme, too. Use the current date and time and never overwrite anything if you want to.

Do you want more control how often to save? Do you want to autosave every 9¾ days for no apparent reason? Well, you can! I don't judge you.
